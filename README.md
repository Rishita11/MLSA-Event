#**MY FIRST EVENT**#

I have created this repository which contains all the necessary information related to my first event which I have conducted as an Alpha Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador on 21st August 2021. 

I have conducted an event on **" How to become an MLSA and Introduction to Web Development"**. In this event I talked about the process of applying for MLSA and perks of this program, the opportunities you get after becoming an MLSA.

After that I gave an brief introduction to web development and roadmap to become one. I have also made a Sign Up form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 


It was a great seesion and I have learned skills such as public speaking, communication skills and event organization and management.
