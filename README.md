-[x] Promotion- It contains the poster and the content which I have circulated on WhatsApp and LinkedIN.
-[x] Presentation- It conatins the presentation which I have used in the session.
-[x] Images- This contains all the images used in the ppt and QR code which is used for feedback of the participants.
-[x] Points to remember- All the points that are required to be taken care of before and after the event.

I have conducted an event on **" How to become an MLSA and Introduction to Web Development"**. In this event I talked about the process of applying for MLSA and perks of this program, the opportunities you get after becoming an MLSA.

After that I gave an brief introduction to web development and roadmap to become one. I have also made a Sign Up form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 


It was a great seesion and I have learned skills such as public speaking, communication skills and event organization and management.
